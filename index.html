          <p class="centered">This project was a mobile app creation that focused on solving a users streaming experience. We all experience endless scrolling when looking for a movie to watch on streaming platforms, this solves it!</p>
          <h2 class="small list centered">My Role</h2>
          <p class="small centered">In this project I focused on developing the user research in order to guide the design of the app. I wanted to add value with a social aspect and bookmarking movies in order to add to your playlist, I created the logo, as well as the general look and feel of the design. I designed the app in dark mode to bring in the feeling of theater and movie streaming to the design aesthetic.</p>

          <p class="centered">I created a research plan objectives to be able to focus our questions in order to receive the information we are looking for. Our objectives were to find out to what a user is experiencing when adopting a new pet, any concerns and pain points. To understand what they are looking for. </p>

              <p class="small">We analyzed our user research data by creating an affinity diagram, by doing this we grouped the information and started to connect the similarities and defining the pain points, overall feedback and user needs. Our key takeaways from our grouping was that a user is interested in filtering, having an ability to watch and schedule movies with friends, sharing, and streaming users were frustrated with trying to remember and stay up to date with streaming platforms.

        <h1 class="centered topMargin">User Flow</h1>
        <p class="centered">While creating the user flow I focused on the onboarding as well as playlist and calendar feature flows. This is a new app that a user would need a tutorial in order to be properly onboarded in the app. The user also needs to create an account and sign in to have the ability to search all their platforms. The challenge with linking this app to the other platform sites was trying to figure out how to make sure the user wouldnâ€™t need to sign into all the other platforms.

           <p class="centered">My team and I created a User Persona that outlines a perspective and goal for a more specific user that would be experiencing the website. Our user focused on having multiple streaming platforms that enjoys spending time with friends and family and having movie nights. She would like to be able to filter her movie options and know what streaming platform that she currently is subscribed to has it for free. 
            She is very frustrated with finding the movies through scrolling or searching multiple times. </p>

                <p class="small">By creating an empathy map we learned how a user may feel while searching the many streaming  platforms that they subscribe to. From the empathy map we discovered what a user may say, think, feel or do as well as pain points and some gains from a new resource. May users subscribe to many platforms, and get frustrated with scrolling, they watch many different kind of movies under many different circumstances. A lot of people enjoy watching movies alone as well as with friends and family.

            <h1 class="centered topMargin">The Problem</h1>
            <p class="centered">During user interviews, we discovered that people want to save time and reduce friction when finding a movie at home.</p> 
            <p class="centered">Therefore, we believe that an app that would compile, filter and suggest movies across platforms for easy navigation would speak to this. We might do this by enabling cross-platform search and filtering based on genre, directors/producers or performers. Doing this will allow our product to help all spectrum of streaming users find movies they want to watch quickly and easily.
